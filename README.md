# Cross - skilling 

This repository is part of my personal learning journey as I focus on cross-skilling in automation tools. It serves as a structured space for me to explore, practice, and deepen my understanding of Playwright.

Here, I’ll be working through various test scenarios and practice exercises as I move through different focus areas and gradually building confidence and expertise in using Playwright. This repository will grow and evolve over time, reflecting both my progress and the skills I’m developing along the way.


# Project setup

To set up playwright ,first we have check if have node.js installed. You can check whether Node.js and npm are already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash

npm -v
```
If it's installed, you’ll see a version number like:

```bash

10.2.0
```
To check the Node.js version specifically:

```bash

node -v
```

#### How to Install Node.js
Go to the official Node.js website:
https://nodejs.org/

Download the LTS version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Run the installer and follow the instructions. It will install both node and npm.

After installation is complete, restart your terminal and verify the installation:

```bash

node -v
npm -v
```
You should now see version numbers for both.
